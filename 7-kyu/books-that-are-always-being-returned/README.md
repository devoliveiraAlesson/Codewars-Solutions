<h2><a href=https://www.codewars.com/kata/64bfc4ee58cbf00c0858a5b1/train/sql target="_blank">Books That Are Always Being Returned</a></h2><h3>7 kyu</h3><p>The library management system uses two main tables - books and loans. The books table contains details about the books, while the loans table contains details about the loans.</p><p><code>books</code>:</p><ul><li><code>book_id</code> (integer) - The unique identifier for a book</li><li><code>title</code> (string) - The title of the book</li><li><code>author</code> (string) - The author of the book</li></ul><p><code>loans</code>:</p><ul><li><code>loan_id</code> (integer) - The unique identifier for a loan</li><li><code>book_id</code> (integer) - The identifier for the book that was loaned, corresponds to book_id in the books table</li><li><code>borrower_name</code> (string) - The name of the person who borrowed the book</li><li><code>return_date</code> (date) - The date when the book was returned. If the book has not yet been returned, this field is null.</li></ul><p>Your task is to write a SQL query to find which books have always been returned every time they have been loaned out.</p><p>In the result set you need to return the <code>book_id</code> and <code>title</code> of books, for all books that have been loaned at least once and aren't currently on-loan (meaning that they do not have records with <code>return_date</code> == null). The result should be ordered by book_id in descending order.</p><p>So thus for such a sample data:</p><p>(books):</p><pre><code>| book_id | title  | author   ||---------|--------|----------|| 1       | Book 1 | Author 1 || 2       | Book 2 | Author 2 || 3       | Book 3 | Author 3 |</code></pre><p>(loans):</p><pre><code>| loan_id | book_id | borrower_name | return_date ||---------|---------|---------------|-------------|| 1       | 1       | User A        | 2023-07-01  || 2       | 1       | User B        | 2023-07-10  || 3       | 2       | User A        | 2023-07-05  || 4       | 2       | User C        | 2023-07-15  || 5       | 3       | User D        | null        || 6       | 3       | User E        | 2023-07-20  |</code></pre><p>The result set would be:</p><pre><code>| book_id | title  ||---------|--------|| 2       | Book 2 || 1       | Book 1 |</code></pre><p>GLHF!</p>
